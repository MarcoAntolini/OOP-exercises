# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Observe and understand the interface `User` and its implementation `UserImpl`. Use the comments to better understand what each method does.
2. Observe and understand the interface `SocialNetworkUser`. Use the comments to better understand what each method does.
3. `SocialNetworkUserImpl` should implements `SocialNetworkUser`, but its implementation is partial. Follow the instructions in the class comments, and build the implementation.
4. Modify `TestSocialNetworkUser` as described in the `TODO` comment, run the test, and make sure that it works correctly.
If it does not, fix the implementation of `SocialNetworkUserImpl`.
