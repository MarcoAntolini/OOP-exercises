     * includes:
     * 
     * 1) A method for setting the next string to print. Null values are not
     * acceptable, and an exception should be produced
     * 
     * 2) A method for getting the next string to print
     * 
     * 3) A method for getting the history of the printed strings (in form of a List
     * of Strings)
     * 
     * 4) A method that prints the current string. If the current string is unset,
     * an IllegalStateException should be thrown
     *
