# Mini-MVC (without a model, actually...)

* Open `Controller`, and follow the instructions in the comments
* Open `SimpleGUI`, and follow the instructions in the comments

**Do not implement the graphical interface before the controller**: in a well designed system, the whole controller could be reused for brand new user interfaces, with *zero* changes!
